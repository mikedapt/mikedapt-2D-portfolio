           <p>For this Project I aligned and edited multiple videos to start at the same point. With the audio there was some variety</p>

		   <p>While I was able to make adjustments to audio in the video editor, I should have used audacity and synced audio there first.</p>

      <p>Python is considered my primary coding language.</p>
	  <p>It is the easiest to structure with the least amount of syntax. Unless I need a complied application, its multiple libraries and integration with many different
	  software makes it possible to do almost everything front end and back end related. I have created some of my biggest projects using Flask and SQL that have been a reliable contribution to the individuals and spaces

      <p>Everything with a Webpage uses HTML</p>
      <p>I learned alot of HTML early from various computer classes, Adobe Products like Dreamweaver, and Javascript related projects which complements HTML and CSS. It is the easiest to pick up on and either mess with or get
      templates to mess with from w3schools. With the use of inspect, it makes it easier to find the location of specific elements or issues in a webpage.</p>

      <p>It's better than Java.</p> 
	  <p>In conjunction to HTML and Dash, I have been the most active in using Javascript to better enhance my projects beyond basic webpage functionality. In the past I have had projects that have caught my interest in VR
	  spaces in the browser rather than on a headset such as Babylon.js and more recently Three.js. If it was not apparent already I really enjoy using and creating environments with Three.js. It is the perfect blend of visual
	  and programming where the results can be seen and interacted with. You can view this best in my Checkers Board Project!</p>

      <p>This was my very first coding language</p> 
	  <p>I started off with Java in high school but got the most out of Java when I started making mobile apps on Android Studio. When Publishing to the Google Play Store, creating a JDK package with a signature has been the way
      for me to publish any additional apps on my Google Developer Account.</p>

      <p>Something needs to compile my projects.</p> 
	  <p>My earliest work in C# was basic animations and actions for objects on Unity such as shooting a projectile, creating collision, or adding movement. I now am learning C# to be able to create applications with executables
      rather than running batch files with a cmd line in the background. I plan to do some future projects/ side hustles using Windows Forms or WPF for creating Desktop and Online executable GUIs.</p>

      <p>Affinity Photo like Photoshop can do it all!</p>
      <p>Going into a technology related field, being able to see results was a priority which is what lead me to doing photo editing and 3d modeling first before programming. Between making adjustments to photos and creating
	  2d/3d Textures for models or on their own, I have used Photoshop for a long time. I currently use Affinity Photo which is able to do the same things if not more.</p>

      <p>Screen, Clipping, Export!</p>
      <p>Creating videos is always a blast whether it is creating a new video from shot assets or making adjustments to existing projects either from camera or OBS. DaVinci Resolve is my favorite and current video editor that is
	  similar to Premiere Pro. Along with mutliple video/audio tracks, I have been able to do audio mixing and background removal in Resolve as well for projects such as the Virtual Choir.</p>

      <p>Always delete the Default Square to make a new one.</p>
      <p>From College, I have also used Maya as well, but I prefer Blender and in many different facets is much more doable despite the shortcut learning curve. I have made many different 3D Models and for most projects was the
	  role I took on. It has allowed for more visual options with perspective and depth to be used in my work.</p>

      <p>We Can have nice things!</p>
      <p>While I still continue to use raster graphics (png,jpg) for the most part in my projects, I have been slowly transitioning or at least having versions of assets as vectors. Many of the assets I had were intended for
      web design which made it difficult to use properly in print, so I had traced over the logo using Affinity Designer to create a vector version that can be good for print. I am also able to add raster elements to a
	  vector which provides more detailing and depth without changing the svg to a png or jpg.</p>
